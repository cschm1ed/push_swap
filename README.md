# push_swap

## Learning Outcomes
- **Time-Complexity:** I learned about the concept of time-complexity and how different algorithms and implementations behave.
- **Sorting algorithms:** I learned about different sorting algorithms and their peculiarities.
- **Data structures:** I learned about different data structures. In this project I used linked lists to implement a stack.

-> Understanding how different algorithms behave in combination with different data structures allows me to find the best way to solve a specific problem in a specific context.

## Implementation

- **Allowed Functions:** read, write, malloc, free, exit, ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded.
- **Specifics:** The programm should display instructions that will sort a stack 'A' using an empty Stack 'B'.

## Available instructions:

- sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- ss : sa and sb at the same time.
- pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
- pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
- ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
- rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
