# libft----a-c-standard-library
--A collection of c standard functions--

The first project of the 42-Cursus (libft) consists of recoding some C-standard functions.
Understanding how these fundamental functions work in detail is necessary to write secure and safe applications.
The libft library will be updated and expanded throughout the 42-Cursus.
